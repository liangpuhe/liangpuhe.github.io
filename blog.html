      <div class="blog-desc">This project is one important item in SAP S4HANA. With the surge of e-commerce business, SAP customers have new demanding for warehouse management software. The burst of e-commerce brings about an increasing number of unregulated return packages and return orders from online shoppers. Warehouse management team are looking for a reliable and efficient tool to assist warehouse clerk handle returned products, and consistent with their existing SAP warehouse management system.</div>

      <h1>Get to Know Our User</h1>
      <div class="blog-content">
        <div class="blog-content-normal">We started with a one-day workshop with stakeholders, including product owner, customer representatives . We invited EWM customers who demand for software assistantship in e-commerce return business. Customers are from various areas including groceries, coffee and cloth industry. The workshop helped us collect information of the return process each customer is doing, their key requirements, and the special concerns in particular industry.</div><img height="400" src="https://d3e54v103j8qbb.cloudfront.net/img/image-placeholder.svg" width="699">

    <div class="blog-content-contianer w-container">
      <h1 class="blog-section-subheader">Define</h1>
      <h1 class="blog-section-header">Co-innovation with Reference Customer</h1>
      <div class="blog-content">
        <div class="blog-content-normal">Later, we clustered our findings to affinity diagram, aiming to select necessary elements in all e-commerce return business we investigated, then concluded several common and important ideas, defining the themes:</div>
        <div class="blog-content-sub">1. Though inspection rules are specially defined for each product, in general, return clerk doesn't follow the rule strictly.
          <br>2. There are unexpected packages every now an then, which cannot be tracked anywhere in system.&nbsp;
          <br>3. Return clerk hardly moves, their main task is processing goods standing still: open package, take out goods, scan, and put away.warehouse manager hopes returned goods can to put away to different area or scrapped according to predefined rules.
          <br>4. Some warehouse doesn't have space for a desktop. Portable device like tablet with scanner is preferred by most customers.</div>
        <div class="blog-content-normal">Considering facts of business and software itself, we prioritized requirements, and decided to work with one persona first -- sports retailer, co-innovating with Decathlon. Then we build a persona "Roberta" for Decathlon return clerk. I also developed storyboard for communication with design central team and developers.</div><img height="400" src="https://d3e54v103j8qbb.cloudfront.net/img/image-placeholder.svg" width="699">
        <div class="blog-content-normal">For e-commerce return application in EWM, we set us two most important goals:</div>
        <div class="blog-content-sub">1. One is from user experience perspective. We ought to provide helpful and neat guide in proper timing, to assist warehouse clerk process returned product correctly and efficiently.&nbsp;
          <br>2. The other one is to program existing system to initiating return process from EWM instead of ERP, recording all the useful information of inspection process to return order creation. At the mean time, the commitment time shall be rigidly short.</div>
      </div>

    <div class="blog-content-contianer w-container">
      <h1 class="blog-section-subheader">Ideation</h1>
      <h1>Lead Smooth Inspection &amp; Trigger Return Process in EWM</h1>
      <div class="blog-content">
        <div class="blog-content-normal">We started solution design with a large amount of user research with questions in detail. We had remote and face-to-face interview several times with open-ended questions and contextual inquiry. And we had field observation in warehouse and directed storytelling. all of our questions and observations mostly focus on following questions:</div>
        <div class="blog-content-sub">1. How warehouse clerk process returned items in your business? Any difference in this process&nbsp;between warehouses in different areas? Could you walk us through the return process?
          <br>2. How do you record unplanned return products in system currently? What else is wanted to improve your business process?
          <br>3. In which step does error or slip happen?
          <br>4. Any other system is related to return process? Did you develop your program?</div>
        <div class="blog-content-normal">According to our understanding of user and customer, we listed input and output of our application:</div><img height="400" src="https://d3e54v103j8qbb.cloudfront.net/img/image-placeholder.svg" width="699">
      </div>

    <div class="blog-content-contianer w-container">
      <h1 class="blog-section-subheader">Prototyping</h1>
      <h1>Validate our Solution</h1>
      <div class="blog-content">
        <div class="blog-content-normal">To be with company strategy, we decided to use Fiori framework for return application. We directly came to&nbsp;build our hi-fi prototype with Fiori stencil.&nbsp;Compared to my other more flexible prototyping&nbsp;experience, I had challenging time designing within&nbsp;constraints of&nbsp;Fiori guideline.</div>
        <div class="blog-content-normal">Fiori has great role-based&nbsp;floorpan to supporting transaction of monitoring and&nbsp;pipeline business. But beside it, we hope to link return clerk’s&nbsp;physical activities with the system interaction, for user’s conceptual model. We had two major problem:</div>
        <div class="blog-content-sub">1. Return clerk needs to inspect different facts of one or several returned product, such as quantity, quality&nbsp;condition, serial number verification. Sometimes return clerk needs to drop a note on this product for other colleagues to do follow-on actions. How to sequence and prioritize all the actions in a singe page? How to arrange secondary information, letting it pop out only if necessary?
          <br>2. Return clerk wants to&nbsp;execute put-away in system when HU (handling unit) is full of returned product, and sometimes needs to create a new one. How to reflect two actions in the system, and avoid twice pop-up?</div>
        <div class="blog-content-normal">We re-examined user scenarios, and categorized user input into necessary, occasionally necessary and nice-to-have. We surely gave first priority to necessary input, and put nice-to-have features in lower positions. For occasional data, take serial number as an example.&nbsp;User mainly capture it on a pop-up window, and able to&nbsp;check or modify it later&nbsp;by clicking tagged&nbsp;abbreviated information on main page.&nbsp;We also designed a group of toggle buttons for condition&nbsp;selection, to restrain user from making mistakes. And the content of those buttons are customizable to provide more flexibility for different business.</div><img height="400" src="https://d3e54v103j8qbb.cloudfront.net/img/image-placeholder.svg" width="699">

      <h1 class="blog-section-subheader">Test</h1>
      <h1 class="blog-section-header">Warehouse Staff Wants our Application</h1>
      <div class="blog-content">
        <div class="blog-content-normal">We had our prototype send to usability test, letting real warehouse clerk in Decathlon&nbsp;play with the prototype. Two of our developer colleagues were able to be on customer site. With the pictures of working scene in Decathlon, they dictated how Roberta used our software and what she said. We distilled several insights from notes token by the whole team.</div>
        <div class="blog-content-sub">1. They almost merely&nbsp;care about the destination and press “put-away” button repetitively for each item.&nbsp;
          <br>2. They had to switch between scanner and mouse
          <br>3. Operating on the screen may distract them from inspecting
          <br>4. They couldn't see well which&nbsp;HU is full</div>
        <div class="blog-content-normal">Accordingly, we calibrated our prototype.</div>
        <div class="blog-content-sub">1. We made the field of destination location much larger with color sign indicating the quality condition and location. And we made it clickable to execute put-away.
          <br>2. We enabled the possibility to run through whole process by scanner without mouse and keyboard. For example, customer could configure a specific code representing put-away, and when user scan it, system would execute put-away. In this way, user could also be more focused on inspection process</div>

      <h1 class="blog-section-subheader">Outlook</h1>
      <h1 class="blog-section-header">The Future of E-commerce Return</h1>
      <div class="blog-content">
        <div class="blog-content-normal">In this project, I worked as user experience advocator first time with a team of developer and software architects. I was lucky to get this chance to practice design-driven software&nbsp;development, and test my design&nbsp;idea with real customers. At meantime, I enjoyed very much propelling my whole development team to think for users, and used information visualization to promote team communication. It made me motivated when I know my work is producing value for users outside in warehouse&nbsp;and I could use their feedback to improve my work constantly. However, mission is not done yet, we still need to see how extendable our product is, and how this tool would meet market trend in a larger scale.</div>

        <div class="blog-content-normal">We started with a one-day workshop with stakeholders, including product owner, customer representatives . We invited EWM customers who demand for software assistantship in e-commerce return business. Customers are from various areas including groceries, coffee and cloth industry. The workshop helped us collect information of return process in their business, and the special concerns in each particular industry, so we could better understand their pains.</div><img height="400" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 209px, (max-width: 767px) 61vw, (max-width: 991px) 458px, 670px" src="images/workshop---s.JPG" srcset="images/workshop---s-p-500x375.jpeg 500w, images/workshop---s.JPG 700w" width="699">

        <div class="blog-content-normal">For e-commerce return application in EWM, we set us two most important goals:</div>
        <div class="blog-content-sub">1. From user experience perspective. We ought to provide helpful and neat guide in proper timing, to assist warehouse clerk process returned product correctly and efficiently.&nbsp;
          <br>2. Program on existing system to initiating return process from EWM instead of ERP, recording all the useful information of inspection process to return order creation. At the mean time, the commitment time shall be rigidly short.</div>

      <h1>Lead Smooth Inspection &amp; Trigger Return Process in EWM</h1>
      <div class="blog-content">
        <div class="blog-content-normal">We had remote and face-to-face interview several times with open-ended questions and contextual inquiry. We had field observation in warehouse and directed storytelling. Our questions and observations mostly focus on following questions:</div>
        <div class="blog-content-sub">1. How warehouse clerk process returned items in your business? Any difference in this process&nbsp;between warehouses in different areas? Could you walk us through the return process?
          <br>2. How do you record unplanned return products in system currently? What else is wanted to improve your business process?
          <br>3. In which step does error or slip happen?
          <br>4. Any other system is related to return process? Did you develop your program?</div>
        <div class="blog-content-normal">According to our understanding of user and customer, we listed information flow of our application:</div><img height="400" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 209px, (max-width: 767px) 61vw, (max-width: 991px) 458px, 670px" src="images/data-io---s.PNG" srcset="images/data-io---s-p-500x246.png 500w, images/data-io---s.PNG 700w" width="745">

      <h1 class="blog-section-subheader">Prototyping</h1>
      <h1>Validate our Solution</h1>
      <div class="blog-content">
        <div class="blog-content-normal">To be with company strategy, we decided to use Fiori framework for return application. Compared to my other more flexible prototyping&nbsp;experience, I had challenging time designing within&nbsp;constraints of&nbsp;Fiori guideline.</div>
        <div class="blog-content-normal">Fiori has great role-based&nbsp;floorpan to supporting transaction of monitoring and&nbsp;pipeline business. But in this return app, we hope to link return clerk’s&nbsp;physical activities with the system interaction, for user’s conceptual model. We had two major problems:</div>
        <div class="blog-content-sub">1. How to sequence and prioritize all the actions in a singe page? How to arrange secondary information? It would be too much if pop-ups
          <br>2. Return clerk wants to&nbsp;execute put-away in system when HU (handling unit) is full of returned product, and sometimes needs to create a new one. How to reflect two actions in the system, and avoid interruption/confusion?</div>
        <div class="blog-content-normal">We re-examined user scenarios, and categorized user input into necessary, occasionally necessary and nice-to-have. We surely gave first priority to necessary input, and put nice-to-have features in lower positions. For occasional data, take serial number as an example.&nbsp;Users mainly capture it on a pop-up window, and able to&nbsp;check or modify it later&nbsp;by clicking tagged&nbsp;abbreviated information on main page.&nbsp;We also designed a group of toggle buttons for condition&nbsp;selection, to restrain user from making mistakes. And the content of those buttons are customizable to provide more flexibility for different business. Final version of Axure prototype cannot be posted due to disclosure issue.</div><img height="400" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 209px, (max-width: 767px) 61vw, (max-width: 991px) 458px, 670px" src="images/returnss---s.PNG" srcset="images/returnss---s-p-500x262.png 500w, images/returnss---s.PNG 695w" width="699">

      <h1 class="blog-section-subheader">Test</h1>
      <h1 class="blog-section-header">Warehouse Staff Wants our Application</h1>
      <div class="blog-content">
        <div class="blog-content-normal">We had our prototype send to usability test, letting real warehouse clerk in Decathlon&nbsp;play with the prototype. Two of our developer colleagues were able to be on customer site. With the pictures of working scene in Decathlon, they dictated how Roberta used our software and what she said. I only list several important gists from notes token by the whole team.</div>
        <div class="blog-content-sub">1. They almost merely&nbsp;care about the destination and press “put-away” button repetitively for each item.&nbsp;
          <br>2. They had to switch between scanner and mouse
          <br>3. Operating on the screen may distract them from inspecting
          <br>4. They couldn't see well which&nbsp;HU is full</div>
        <div class="blog-content-normal">Accordingly, we calibrated our prototype.</div>
        <div class="blog-content-sub">1. We made the field of destination location much larger with color sign indicating the quality condition and next destination. And we made it clickable to execute put-away.
          <br>2. We enabled the possibility to run through whole process by scanner without mouse and keyboard. For example, customer could configure a specific code representing put-away, and when user scan it, system would execute put-away. In this way, user could also be more focused on inspection process</div>

      <h1 class="blog-section-subheader">Outlook</h1>
      <h1 class="blog-section-header">The Future of E-commerce Return</h1>
      <div class="blog-content">
        <div class="blog-content-normal">In this project, I worked as user experience advocator first time with a team of developer and software architects. I was lucky to get this chance to practice design-driven software&nbsp;development, and test my design&nbsp;idea with real customers. At meantime, I enjoyed very much propelling my whole development team to think for users, and used information visualization to promote team communication. It made me motivated when I know my work is producing value for users outside in warehouse&nbsp;and I could use their feedback to improve my work constantly. However, mission is not done yet, we still need to see how extendable our product is, and how this tool would meet market trend in a larger scale.</div>

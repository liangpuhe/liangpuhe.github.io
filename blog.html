      <h1 class="blog-section-subheader">Prototyping</h1>
      <h1>Validate our Solution</h1>
      <div class="blog-content">
        <div class="blog-content-normal">For UI harmonization, we decided to use <a href="http://www.sap.com/product/technology-platform/fiori.html">Fiori</a> framework for return application. Compared to my other more flexible prototyping&nbsp;experience, I had challenging time designing within&nbsp;constraints of&nbsp;<a href="https://experience.sap.com/fiori-design/">Fiori design guideline</a>.</div>
        <div class="blog-content-normal">Fiori has great role-based&nbsp;floorpan to supporting transaction of monitoring and&nbsp;pipeline business. But in this return app, we hope to link return clerk’s&nbsp;physical activities with the system interaction, to build intuitive <a href="http://www.sharritt.com/CISHCIExam/norman.html">conceptual model</a>. We had two major problems:</div>
        <div class="blog-content-sub">1. How to sequence and prioritize all the actions in a singe page, so that the user could finish task without bother to scroll? How to arrange secondary information? It would be too much if all pop-ups
          <br>2. Return clerk wants to&nbsp;execute put-away in system when HU (handling unit) is full of returned product, and sometimes needs to create a new HU. How to reflect two actions in the system, and avoid interruption/confusion?</div>
        <div class="blog-content-normal">We re-examined user scenarios, and categorized user input into necessary, occasionally necessary and nice-to-have. We surely gave first priority to the necessary input, and put nice-to-have features in lower positions. For occasional data, take serial number as an example.&nbsp;Users mainly capture it on a pop-up window, and able to&nbsp;check or modify it later&nbsp;by clicking tagged&nbsp;abbreviated information on main page.&nbsp;We also designed a group of toggle buttons for condition&nbsp;selection, to restrain user from making mistakes.(This was proved to be effective in A/B test) And the content of those buttons are customizable to provide more flexibility for different business. Final version of Axure prototype after four times iteration cannot be posted due to non-disclosure agreement.</div><img class="blog-content-img" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 94vw, (max-width: 767px) 61vw, (max-width: 991px) 458px, 670px" src="images/returnss---s.PNG" srcset="images/returnss---s-p-500x262.png 500w, images/returnss---s.PNG 695w" width="699">

      <h1 class="blog-section-subheader">Test</h1>
      <h1 class="blog-section-header">Warehouse Staff Wants our Application</h1>
      <div class="blog-content">
        <div class="blog-content-normal">We had our prototype send to usability test, letting real warehouse clerk play with the prototype. Two of our developer colleagues were able to be on customer site. With the pictures of working scene in warehouse, they dictated how Roberta used our software and what she said. I only list several important gists derived from notes token by the whole team.</div>
        <div class="blog-content-sub">1. They almost merely&nbsp;care about the destination and press “put-away” button repetitively for each item.&nbsp;
          <br>2. They had to switch between scanner and mouse
          <br>3. Operating on the screen may distract them from inspecting
          <br>4. They couldn't see well which&nbsp;HU is full</div>
        <div class="blog-content-normal">Accordingly, we calibrated our prototype.</div>
        <div class="blog-content-sub">1. We made the field of destination location much larger with color sign indicating the quality condition and next destination. And we made it clickable to execute put-away.
          <br>2. We enabled the possibility to run through whole process by scanner without mouse and keyboard. For example, customer could configure a specific code representing put-away, and when user scan it, system would execute put-away. In this way, user could also be more focused on inspection process</div>

      <h1 class="blog-section-subheader">Outlook</h1>
      <h1 class="blog-section-header">The Future of E-commerce Return</h1>
      <div class="blog-content">
        <div class="blog-content-normal">In this project, I worked as user experience advocator first time with a team of developer and software architects. I was lucky to get this chance to practice design-driven software&nbsp;development, and test my design&nbsp;idea with real customers. At meantime, I enjoyed very much propelling my whole development team to think for users, and used information visualization to promote team communication. It made me motivated when I know my work is producing value for users outside in warehouse&nbsp;and I could use their feedback to improve my work constantly. However, mission is not done yet, we still need to see how extendable our product is, and how this tool would meet market trend in a larger scale.</div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="blog-content-contianer w-container">
      <h1 class="blog-section-subheader">Reflection</h1>
      <h1 class="blog-section-header">What we could do better</h1>
      <div class="blog-content">
        <div class="blog-content-normal">There are still things I am skeptical about. For example, the understanding phase is based on communication with warehouse manager, without involving&nbsp;the first stakeholder who directly uses our APP— warehouse return clerk. Would there be better and more efficiency design iteration, if we involve them in the beginning before we have built our mind? How we organize a gathering of warehouse clerks from different area? What should be prepare?
          <br>
          <br>The most undesired consequence is that the end user only found bad usability issue after the product is released to market, even though the product has passed the&nbsp;usability test in a given context — lab. Because of the company cooperation myths, we hardly have access to observe&nbsp;end user in requirement gathering phrase.&nbsp;It also happens in another project I am working on recently. Before I could convince the leadership invest more in customer relations,&nbsp;I am also thinking actively with what was given, how to refine our design&nbsp;process to focus on the as&nbsp;best task as we can in each phrase.</div>

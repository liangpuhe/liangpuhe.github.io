      <div class="blog-desc">This is a project I worked in an SAP internal startup program — IoT Challenge. The team was made up among participants from different departments. I worked as scrum master and user experience designer in our 12-people scrum team. The program lasted 3 weeks including building team, design solution, and prototyping. The outcome was evaluated by prototype demo and code evidence. Our team eventually got the first position in global finalists.</div>

      <h1 class="blog-section-subheader ubi">BEFORE</h1>
      <h1>Getting Prepared for Sprint</h1>
      <div class="blog-content">
        <div class="blog-content-normal">Before three-week challenge starts, we were notified the topic of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usage-based_insurance">User Based Vehicle Insurance</a>, so we had about two weeks to go through business and technical background before meeting the team. The idea is to collect each driver’s personal and car data, then provide information for insurance company to devise personalized premiere plan for individual end customer. Therefore, the end customer could pay the insurance as how they drive. For example, conventional and seldom car user could get cheaper vehicle insurance price. Our goal is to provide insurance companies enough information to do better predication and make money from it.</div>
        <div class="blog-content-normal">To get myself prepared for agile project management, I read some articles about agile development which are prevailing among start-ups, and&nbsp;I was inspired by <a href="https://developers.google.com/design-sprint/product/">Design Sprint</a> and <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2011/03/lean-ux-getting-out-of-the-deliverables-business/">Lean UX</a>. Besides the basic rules&nbsp;of scrum we are used to in&nbsp;daily work, I believed that&nbsp;in this challenge,&nbsp;we should pay extra attention on solving gap problem&nbsp;and getting validation from stakeholder in each segment. And I also learnt some efficient technique to promote team collaboration and resolve conflicts. For example, the first action I took was to book a huge conference room, gathered desks in the center for immediate discussion.</div>

      <h1 class="blog-section-subheader ubi">SPRINT 1 <em>July 11th - 14th</em></h1>
      <h1 class="blog-section-header">How to Get Comfortable with This New Area?</h1>
      <div class="blog-content">
        <h3 class="blog-content-h3">Meet stakeholders &amp; interview with users</h3>
        <div class="blog-content-normal">To get familiar with insurance industries, we got contact with vehicle&nbsp;insurance sales, insurance analyst in Shanghai, and SAP insurance system product owner. We conducted interviews with them to know their working content, and discussed how IoT data could help boost insurance company business. I organized team&nbsp;meeting with internal&nbsp;technical expert to explore possibilities of existing platform(such as SAP Vehicle Insight).</div>
        <div class="blog-content-normal">Both insurance staff and driver are our target users. In the interview with insurance staff, we focused on question — what driver/car information is used in their work? what would be useful in ideal situation?</div>
        <div class="blog-content-normal">The outcome is more interesting and fruitful when we had structured interviews with drivers. After comparing notes taken from 10 interviews, we found:</div>
        <div class="blog-content-sub">- Drivers are in different safety levels. A number of drivers are skeptical whether such insurance strategy could save them money.&nbsp;
          <br>- Some drivers are concerned with data and privacy, while the others don’t really care.
          <br>- All of our interviewed drivers would love to have an overview of their oil consumption and safety level based on ubiquitous computing.</div>
        <h3 class="blog-content-h3">Competitive analysis</h3>
        <div class="blog-content-normal">According to online resources and idea owner,&nbsp;UBI had been widely used in U.S. There are also some Chinese start-ups initiating UBI market.&nbsp;We did competitive analysis on both domestic and global competitors. Research on global competitors is only based on website information, while we investigated domestic software by playing around APP and talking with real users.</div><img class="blog-content-img" src="images/competitive.png">
        <h3 class="blog-content-h3">Brainstorming</h3>
        <div class="blog-content-normal">We found <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/270218711_DEVELOPMENT_OF_A_RISK_ASSESSMENT_TOOL_BASED_ON_DRIVER_BEHAVIOR_AND_ENVIRONMENT">reference essay</a> which lists a number of factors influencing driving safety. Then we brainstormed “how IoT device accompanied with other technology could retrieve information of these factors”. Every team member wrote down what they thought is useful, and we cluttered them into&nbsp;affinity diagram. Then we evaluated viability --&nbsp; "data resource could really&nbsp;be used in real-world business" and feasibility — "finish prototype with the data in three weeks" . In the end, we concluded to include some data from device, and mock some data which could be retrieved legally and feasibly in the future.</div><img height="400" src="https://d3e54v103j8qbb.cloudfront.net/img/image-placeholder.svg" width="699">
        <h3 class="blog-content-h3">Business model</h3>
        <div class="blog-content-normal">Based on selected data resource, we settled partners we will cooperate with, such as OBD adapter manufacture and transportation department, as following BMI map.</div><img class="blog-content-img" height="400" src="images/BMI - s.png" width="699">

    <div class="blog-content-contianer w-container">
      <h1 class="blog-section-header">How We Organized Sprints?</h1>
      <div class="blog-content">
        <div class="blog-content-normal">As scrum master, I was responsible for strategic process plan to help the team approach our design goal.</div>
        <div class="blog-content-sub">1. I organized review meetings with stakeholders(product owner, idea owner and the team, and sometimes includes insurance experts) at the end of each release. In review meeting, we followed the list of KPIs set in planning meetings, and we heard feedback from stakeholders, which also required us to demo or at least have something to present the process.
          <br>2. It turns out good and straights up the process. It is a bit thorny in first sprint before we defined KPIs and precise goals. I had to be careful with choosing efficient meeting forms to solve apropos problem in schedule. For example, we first broadcast the theme of UBI. The most obvious problem comes along is how to measure safety level? But that is a too broad question. We quickly pinned down a specific topic for whole team brainstorming. It proved to be effective.
          <br>3. In such short and intensive development, we have to be agile to adjust our space and methodology. It is also very important to hear voice from the team always. Initially, we agreed on two stand-up meetings per day to update individual progress in the morning and evening. I proactively asked their feelings of our scrum after several days trial, and shortened the communication time accordingly afterwards.</div>

      <h1>Define User Scenario</h1>
      <div class="blog-content">
        <div class="blog-content-normal">Although our workflow was unclear at the beginning of sprint 2, engineers could get start with data flow in parallel. we separated our 12 engineers into two groups. One for figuring out how to introduce data we need from different resources to SAP HANA&nbsp;system. And the other group continued with business and design.</div><img class="blog-content-img" height="400" src="images/UBI persona - s.png" width="699">
        <div class="blog-content-normal">We defined two user scenarios for prototyping.</div>
        <div class="blog-content-sub">1. Our system&nbsp;collects data from IoT device(OBD, GPS, weather, road condition), and use data visualization tool(SAP&nbsp;CVOM and Lumira) to provide insights for insurance analyst, and use trained algorithm from <a href="http://help.sap.com/saphelp_hanaplatform/helpdata/en/32/731a7719f14e488b1f4ab0afae995b/frameset.htm">HANA PAL</a>&nbsp;to calculate a safety score as a quick view and price reference.&nbsp;
          <br>2. Driver user could claim car accident by single click on mobile APP, with the accident trip data uploaded together, which saves driver’s time, meanwhile avoid insurance fraud.</div>

      <h1 class="blog-section-subheader ubi">SPINT 3 <em>July 16th - 26th</em></h1>
      <h1>User Experience Engineering</h1>
      <div class="blog-content">
        <div class="blog-content-normal">In this sprint, the whole team focused on development. Tasks were separated into three major categories:&nbsp;front-end development, ODATA&nbsp;data model development, training algorithm&nbsp;on <a href="https://hcp.sap.com/index.html">HCP</a>(SAP HANA CLOUD PLATFORM). I joined front-end development via UI5, and designed sample charts for insurance analyst. Sample charts are to visualize information of trip data and comparison with other drivers who share some same characteristics.</div>
        <div class="blog-content-normal">I was blocked for sometime, when I designed one of the charts to show a driver's dangerous behaviors overview. My initial idea was using bubble chart, and analyst could choose shapes/colors of detected behavior which he is interested in.</div><img class="blog-content-img" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 100vw, (max-width: 767px) 60vw, (max-width: 991px) 458px, 670px" src="images/charts.png" srcset="images/charts-p-500x223.png 500w, images/charts.png 759w">
        <div class="blog-content-normal">However, later I found it is not a clever solution for analyst to define a driver's safety level or compare one driver with another. Using x,y axis to present road condition and speed is also problematic. For example, chart of an extreme dangerous driver may have all "bad behavior" shape stack on the upper right corner. It is not illustrative because of the overlapping and varying bubble layout.</div>
        <div class="blog-content-normal">I had several other versions of this chart design, and had some speed-dating test with my developer and UX colleagues. The results were not so promising, so I had to split related information into two charts. This failure haunted me even after the project, until one day I was inspired by <a href="http://www.infovis-wiki.net/index.php?title=Linking_and_Brushing">Linking and Brushing</a>. I could use radar chart to visualize the general severity of each danger type, and link the node to another xy coordinate with focus on upper big shape(by <a href="https://www.amcharts.com/">amCharts</a>).</div><img class="blog-content-img" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 100vw, (max-width: 767px) 60vw, (max-width: 991px) 458px, 621px" src="images/amChart.png" srcset="images/amChart-p-500x479.png 500w, images/amChart.png 621w">

      <h1 class="blog-section-header">Storytelling</h1>
      <div class="blog-content">
        <div class="blog-content-normal">Prototyping demo is an important factor of IoT challenge competition. With 10-min time limitation, we need to be very&nbsp;persuasive in&nbsp;explaining business value and technical feasibility.&nbsp;&nbsp;We spent last three days in preparing a solid scenario to demo our idea.</div>
        <div class="blog-content-normal">While introducing background story, I found a great tool in SAP — <a href="https://experience.sap.com/designservices/approach/scenes">Scene</a>, to help us quickly lead audience to the scenario without need to make animation ourselves. And I personally fell in love with such storytelling method, and used it often in my other project. (Also Inspired by <a href="http://simpleshow.com/hk-en/">simpleshow</a>)</div>

      <h1 class="blog-section-header">Learning</h1>
      <div class="blog-content">
        <div class="blog-content-normal">Our solution is not yet perfect. Our UBI solution&nbsp;is challenged by <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/16/your-money/auto-insurance/tracking-gadgets-could-lower-your-car-insurance-at-the-price-of-some-privacy.html?_r=0">privacy issue</a>. It is indeed a problem for especially western people who care much about privacy, and feel uncomfortable being “monitored”, even though we promised detail trip data would be encrypted, and merely derive overall accumulated information from entire driving history.We are still seeking for a way for UBI to survive in the fierce debate about privacy and big data.</div>
        <div class="blog-content-normal">Basically, we did well in&nbsp;agile project development. Deliver and KPI validation in each sprint ensured us to be&nbsp;with track and&nbsp;schedule. What I found could be improved was documentation. We took it for granted that we should skip well-made documentation or sorting out discussion results in such tight schedule. But for a team size of 12, documentation is useful to keep every team mate on the same stage. Neat and clear document could even save more time on repetitive&nbsp;communication and avoid digression.</div>
